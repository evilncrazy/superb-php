superb-php
==========

Generate nicely formatted HTML using PHP.

```php
include('superb.php');

echo
Sp::div(array('class' => 'container'),
   Sp::h1('Hi there!'),
   Sp::p('This is ', Sp::b('superb'), '!')
);
```

```html
<div class='container'>
   <h1>Hi there!</h1>
   <p>
      This is
      <b>Superb</b>
      !
   </p>
</div>
```

Basic Usage
===========

Grab **superb.php** and include it into your PHP file.
Anything in the form of ```Sp::name( ... )``` will return a tag, with any markup inside the brackets attached as children of this tag.

What can go in the brackets?

* **string**: A string simply corrosponds to plain text in the content of the tag
* **array**: An array of attribute-value pairs
* **function**: The function is called with a new Sp instance as the parameter. Any markup generated by this Sp instance will be attached to the tag.

Remember to echo the markup, as they are returned as a string. Enjoy!

Function Parameters
===================

If a function is given as a parameter, you'll be given a Sp instance to generate markup, like so:

```php
Sp::ul(function($sp) {
   foreach(array('A', 'B', 'C') as $char) {
      $sp->li($char);
   }
});
```

```html
<ul>
   <li>A</li>
   <li>B</li>
   <li>C</li>
</ul>
```

This allows you to write logic without breaking the flow of markup.

Aliases
=======

There are special Superb tags called **aliases** that help generate common tags. For instance, ```Sp::css('style.css')``` generates ```<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">```
